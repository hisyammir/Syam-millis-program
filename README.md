"# Syam-millis-program" 
This program is made to take advantage of millis() in executing a function.

millis(), on the other hand, is a function that returns the amount of milliseconds that have passed since program start.

In my opinion, instead of using the delay () function, it's better to use millis () because:

- Accurate timing

- no words running the program while "waiting" (using delay())
